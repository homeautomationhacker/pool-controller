# pool-controller
Arduino project to control a pool controller using Amazon Echo and Wemos D1 mini

## Background
This all started when I was visiting my in-laws and I noticed that every time my father-in-law wanted to switch his pool from pool to spa or turn the lights on he had to walk around the side of the house to flip switches on a control unit.  Being the inquisitive and tinkerer of the family I started researching how to control this panel with his Amazon Echo.  

Let me say, this needs to be simple and can't rely on any other hubs other than the Wemos.  I chose to use the [Wemos D1 Mini](https://wiki.wemos.cc/products:d1:d1_mini) for it's ESP8266 chipset along with [Sinric](https://www.sinric.com) for the Echo to JSON integration.  Again, *simple*.

### Disclaimer
I'm not a great developer, just a hacker who hobbies this stuff up and tinkers around my own house.
